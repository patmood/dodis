# Do Dis
## A command line todo list in python

Do Dis is an extremely simple todo list manager for the commanline. The name sounds like "Do This", but "dd" makes for a better command alias!

## Installation

Clone this repo and simply run `python dodis.py` to get started.

For regular use and fast execution, add the following alias shell:

`dd = python ~/path/to/dodis/dodis.py`

This allows you to quickly add items from anywhere by running `dd -a Buy some milk`

## Usage

Usage:

`python dodis.py [options]`

Options:

```
-h, --help        show all options
-t, --title       change the list title
-a, --add         add a list item
-d, --delete      delete a list item
-r, --reset       reset a list
```

## Credit

Dodis was inspired by Steve Tosh's "t" http://stevelosh.com/projects/t/. An awesome project that I wanted to attempt myself while learning python.
